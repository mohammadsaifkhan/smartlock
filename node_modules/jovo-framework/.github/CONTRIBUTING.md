# Contributing to the Jovo Framework

Thanks a lot for considering to contribute to Jovo ‚ù§Ô∏èüîä

Jovo is an open source framework that makes it easier for developers to build cross-platform voice apps. 
Here are some suggestions how you can help us to make Jovo better:

## Spread the Word

You don't have to make crazy code changes to Jovo to become a contributor. Help other people discover Jovo by sharing or creating content.

* Leave us a star on GitHub and increase Jovo's visibility as an open-source framework
* Write a [blog post](https://medium.com/@mariomenti/creating-a-cross-platform-voice-app-using-jovo-f9ee373569c) and share your learnings with the community
* Give a presentation and speak about Jovo at a local [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/amazon-alexa/)

## Share Code

You can have a huge impact on Jovo without ever touching the framework's core.

* Open source a [project](https://github.com/FlorianHollandt/skillPlayer-basic) and help others learn Jovo by showing your code
* Build a [plugin](https://github.com/cellular/jovo-plugin-raven) and help others extend Jovo easily

## Add new Features

Adding to Jovo's core can sometimes be daunting for beginners. Here are some ideas.

* Investigate [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/issues) and find out what people are currently discussing.
* Add one of the [missing features](../README.md#missing)

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
